"""prepare_release.py

Usage:
  .release/prepare_release.py
  .release/prepare_release.py -h
  .release/prepare_release.py --help

Information:
  This script based on KCM_RELEASE_VER variable prepares kcm release
  KCM_RELEASE_VER variable should follow pattern vX.Y.Z[-rcV] where
    X,Y,Z       number between 0 and 9          (required)
    -rc         release candidate indicator     (optional)
    V           number between 0 and 99         (required only when \"-rc\" is present)
  Examples: v.0.1.9, v4.1.7-rc1, v.7.0.9-rc44

  Before using this script, read RELEASE.md
  Make sure that your working branch is:
   - "master" branch
   - up to date with origin/master
   - clean
  Make sure that there is no local branch named "kcm-release-KCM_RELEASE_VER"
  Make sure that there is no remote branch named "kcm-release-KCM_RELEASE_VER"
  Make sure that there is no tag KCM_RELEASE_VER present (locally or remotely)
  Make sure that there is no release with tag KCM_RELEASE_VER present

  ======= IMPORTANT NOTE =======
  After RP with release is reviewed, use "Rebase and merge" in Github PR webpage.
  Jenkins CI/CD is triggered to make release based on specific commit message
  that is setup by this script.


Options:
  -h --help             Show this screen.
