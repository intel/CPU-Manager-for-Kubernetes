# Known issues

## Potential race between Kubernetes scheduler and pool state.

If a `cmk isolate` process terminates abnormally in a way that prevents
releasing the assigned CPU list (e.g. because it was sent the KILL
signal), then there is an interval of time between process termination
and when `cmk reconcile` is able to remove the invalid process ID from
the CMK configuration directory. During this interval, although the opaque
integer resource becomes available, the next invocation of `cmk isolate` may
not be able to safely make an allocation. In this case, `cmk isolate` should
be expected to crash with a nonzero exit status. This appears to the operator
as a filed pod launch. The scheduler will try to reschedule the pod.
This condition will persist on the affected node until `cmk reconcile` has a
chance to run, at which point it will detect that the saved process ID from
the reaped container is no longer valid and free the cores for reuse.

## Potential conflict with process ID reuse by the OS kernel.

If a `cmk isolate` process terminates abnormally in a way that prevents
releasing the assigned CPU list (e.g. because it was sent the KILL
signal), then there is an interval of time between process termination
and when `cmk reconcile` is able to remove the invalid process ID from
the CMK configuration directory. During this interval, if another
process is started and the kernel happens to recycle the old PID, then
`cmk reconcile` will not be able to detect the leaked CPU list.
This scenario should be very rare in practice.

## `cmk init` flag values for `--num-shared-cores` and `--num-exclusive-cores` must be positive integers

This places constratints on the construction of the user container
command value. Zero is also unsupported.

## The flag value for `--interval` (used in `cmk reconcile` and `cmk node-report`) must be an integer.

Fractional seconds are unsupported.
